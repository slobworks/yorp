**New!** Version 0.2 adds a full amp of extra current capacity, and has adjustable output. 3.6V output now stably handles CPUs that require just a wee bit more voltage than 3.3V on the nose, and the extra current ought to improve operation with Cyrix 5x86 CPUs.

If anyone really wants to replace an LT1085 doing 3.3V duty on a 486 motherboard with a buck converter equivalent and doesn't mind the prospect of rewiring some stuff for it, I've made 'Yorp', a three pin buck converter board based on the Diodes AP63301WU 3A Synchronous Buck. 

I've made one of these and put it in my PB450 motherboard based Packard Bell Legend 10CDT, where it works quite well driving an Am5x86 at 133MHz.

Depending on how the LT1085 is set up on your motherboard, you _might_ have to remove some parts and do some rewiring so that the GND terminal actually goes to GND without causing something else on the motherboard to misbehave. As always, rigorously check for bad things like short circuits to ground using a multimeter before applying power!

Bill of materials:

-1x AP63301WU Adjustable Buck Regulator in SOT-23-5 (https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/diodes-incorporated/AP63301WU-7/10491607)

-1x 107K 0805/2012 metric SMD resistor

-1x 30.1K 0805/2012 metric SMD resistor

-5x 10uF 25V 2012/3216 metric SMD ceramic caps, X5R/X7R 

-1x 100nF 0805/2012 metric SMD ceramic cap, C0G

-1x 51pF 0805/2012 metric SMD ceramic cap, C0G

-1x 4.7uH 6.3mm x 6.3mm SMD inductor rated for _at least_ 4.5A saturation current (I used one of these: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/murata-electronics/1255AY-4R7M-P3/5271453)

-1x 2.54mm pitch, 3-pin, pin header


Some Q&A:

**Why would I want to do this?**
- Reduce heat generated by the 3.3V regulation (Yorp runs just barely above room temperature when powering an Am5x86 at 133MHz, compared to the LT1085 quickly reaching first degree burn-inflicting temperature)
- Improve electrical efficiency of your 486 system
- Coolness factor (be the first kid on your block with an 80 plus capable vintage computer, after putting a modern PSU with an ATX->AT adaptor on your machine!)

**Would this work with an Intel 486DX4 or Am5x86-133?**

Yep!

**Would this work with a Cyrix 5x86-100/120?**

Starting with Version 0.2, Yorp should provide sufficient voltage and current capacity to hopefully run the Cyrix 5x86-type CPUs stably.

**Wait a minute! The far left pin is the ADJUST pin for the LT1085! How the hell am I going to get GROUND there?**

That is up to you to figure out. While not a particularly difficult mod to build, the implementation will require you to study your 486 motherboard a bit first before jumping in. On my Packard Bell PB450 motherboard, all I had to do was remove any resistors on R124 and R131, and short R131 together using a little snipped piece of capacitor leg. Your board will certainly vary, so study it up first!
