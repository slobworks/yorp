If anyone really wants to replace an LT1085 doing 3.3V duty on a 486 motherboard with a buck converter equivalent and doesn't mind the prospect of rewiring some stuff for it, I've made 'Yorp', a three pin buck converter board based on the Diodes AP63203WU 3.3V 2A Synchronous Buck. 

Now, mind you, LT1085s are rated up to 3A but the relatively frugal AMD Am5x86-133 is specced up to 960mA-ish worst case (so slightly less than 1A), so you've still got around an amp of headroom when running at stock speeds. The Cyrix 5x86 wants 3.45V and quite a bit more power though, 1.2A at 100MHz or 1.4A at 120MHz, so you may want to consider reworking Yorp to take a beefier buck converter if you want to use a higher current draw CPU, especially if you intend to overclock (will also require reworking the PCB and schematic likewise). 

I've made one of these and put it in my PB450 motherboard based Packard Bell Legend 10CDT, where it works quite well driving an Am5x86 at 100MHz (lower speed is because I forgot to solder in the multiplier jumper, LOL). 

Depending on how the LT1085 is set up on your motherboard, you _might_ have to remove some parts and do some rewiring so that the GND terminal actually goes to GND without causing something else on the motherboard to misbehave. As always, rigorously check for bad things like short circuits to ground using a multimeter before applying power!

Bill of materials:

-1x AP63205WU 3.3V Buck Regulator in SOT-23-5 (https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/diodes-incorporated/AP63205WU-7/9858424)

-5x 10uF 25V 2012/3216 metric SMD ceramic caps, X5R/X7R 

-1x 100nF 0805/2012 metric SMD ceramic cap, C0G

-1x 3.9uH 6.3mm x 6.3mm SMD inductor rated for _at least_ 2A saturation current (I used one of these: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/murata-electronics/1255AY-3R9N-P3/6205579)

-1x 2.54mm pitch, 3-pin, pin header

Some Q&A:
**Why would I want to do this?**
- Reduce heat generated by the 3.3V regulation (Yorp runs just barely above room temperature when powering an Am5x86 at 100MHz, compared to the LT1085 quickly reaching first degree burn-inflicting temperature)
- Improve electrical efficiency of your 486 system
- Coolness factor (be the first kid on your block with an 80 plus capable vintage computer, after putting a modern PSU with an ATX->AT adaptor on your machine!)

**Would this work with an Intel 486DX4 or Am5x86-133?**
Yep!

**Would this work with a Cyrix 5x86-100/120?**
_Probably_, but these CPUs really want 3.45V and draw quite a bit more power, up to 1.4A for the 120MHz model. If you intend to do any "extreme overclocking" then 2A is probably not enough for what you want to do, so you may have to fire up KiCAD on your end and rejig the device to take a 3A rated buck converter instead. Maybe even one that kicks out 15mV more voltage too, you never know.

**Wait a minute! The far left pin is the ADJUST pin for the LT1085! How the hell am I going to get GROUND there?**
That is up to you to figure out. While not a particularly difficult mod to build, the implementation will require you to study your 486 motherboard a bit first before jumping in. On my Packard Bell PB450 motherboard, all I had to do was remove any resistors on R124 and R131, and short R131 together using a little snipped piece of capacitor leg. Your board will certainly vary, so study it up first!
